Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

  I am an up-and-coming junior developer on the cusp of earning my A.S. in Computer Science from City College of San Francisco. 
  My journey in the world of coding has been fueled by a passion for creating solutions and a curiosity for the intricacies of technology. 
  Proficient in languages such as C++, SQL, Python, and Javascript, I find joy in the elegant blend of logic and creativity that programming offers.
  From crafting robust algorithms to designing seamless user interfaces using HTML and CSS, I bring a versatile skill set to the table.
  My coding arsenal includes the efficient use of tools like VS Code, and I've recently embarked on the exciting journey of ðŸŒ± learning React
  to further enhance my web development capabilities. Eager to contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of technology, I am committed to continuous learning
  and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the digital realm. Let's build something amazing together!

  ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a World Healthcare Access chat app as a class project.
